# 📍 Coding Problems

## 🦅 Overview

In this section (in current java package), I have added a list of coding problems that I have found on the Internet, and
I have found them quite interesting and useful in learning algorithms.

If you want to get even more value from this section, please try to solve these tasks by yourself before looking onto my
implementations.

## 📙 Task #1

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

**Bonus:** Can you do this in one pass?

## 📒 Task #2

Implement algorithm that shows if all characters in a given string are unique.

**Bonus**: What if you are not allowed to use other data structures?
